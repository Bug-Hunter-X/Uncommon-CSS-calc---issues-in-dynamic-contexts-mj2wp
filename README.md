# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Issues

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function, particularly in situations involving dynamic sizing and flexbox layouts.

## Problem
The `calc()` function is powerful for dynamic calculations within CSS, but it needs careful handling.  Unexpected results can occur when used with:

*   **Dynamic parent element widths:** If the parent container's width isn't explicitly defined or changes dynamically, `calc()`'s results may be unexpected.
*   **Flexbox layouts:**  Calculating values within flexbox items can lead to unexpected outcomes because flexbox dynamically manages element sizes. 

The `bug.css` file showcases examples of these problems.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.css` file offers solutions and best practices to mitigate these unexpected behaviors using alternative approaches such as specifying explicit widths, using viewport units, or adjusting the flexbox layout to ensure predictable results.

## Usage
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open `bug.html` (create this file if it does not exist) and include the CSS files to observe the behavior of the incorrect and correct approaches.

This demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the context when using the `calc()` function in CSS.
