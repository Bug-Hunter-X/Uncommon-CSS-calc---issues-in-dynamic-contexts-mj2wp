The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, it can sometimes produce unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not defined or is dynamic. Another example is using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item; this could produce unexpected results because flexbox items have their width dynamically set.
